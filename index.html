                    We have previously shown that states of disease progression and regression are strongly associated with the M1/M2 activation
                    status of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage populations in the atherosclerotic plaques. However,
                    the dynamics of monocyte colonization and transformation to resident macrophage populations during either
                    plaque progression or regression are poorly understood. We use a combination of tamoxifen inducible fate
                    mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing methodologies to profile arterial plaque-resident cells derived
                    from CX3CR1+ monocyte precursors in mice. Overall, this study highlights previously unidentified genes
                    and programs in macrophages associated with atherosclerosis progression and regression, uncovering the
                    unexpected plasticity of CX3CR1+ monocyte derived cells and the role they may play in the dynamics of
                    an atherosclerotic plaque.

                    1) Identify the population of origin for plaque-resident macrophages
                    <ul class="dashlist">
                        <li>What genes are highly expressed in this population?</li>
                        <li>What cell type does this population resemble?</li>
                    </ul>
                    2) Characterize heterogeity of plaque-resident Cx3cr1<sup>+</sup> macrophage derived cells:
                    <ul class="dashlist">
                        <li>What are the characteristic expression patterns of each cluster?</li>
                    </ul>
                    3) Identify differences in populations found in plaque progression and regression:
                    <ul class="dashlist">
                        <li>Are certain cell populations preferentially found in each experimental group?</li>
                        <li>What genes are over-expressed in each experimental group?</li>
                    </ul>

                    After pre-processing, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm for clustering of cells from both experiemntal groups. 
                    We then use PCA (with 32 dimensions) followed by t-SNE for visualization of the single cell populations in 2-dimensions. 
                    Above are t-SNE plots of the Louvain clusters alongside the experimental group to which each cell belongs.

                    Here we compare the proportion of the two experimental groups composing each of the clusters.
                    On the left is represented the percentage of each experimental groups's cells found in each cluster.
                    On the right is the proportion of each cluster which is composed by each experimental group.
